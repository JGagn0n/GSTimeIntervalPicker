## GSTimeIntervalPicker

A UI component for picking time interval, with the support of setting upper time interval limit.

## Why does this exist?
When building Reminders in [Timelines](http://timelinesapp.io), I stumbled upon the need of letting users pick a time interval between 0 and 3 hours. UIDatePicker in its .CountDownTimer mode supports almost what I needed, but not quite - there is no way how to limit the time interval. With this class, I attempted to fully replicate this UIDatePicker-countDownTimer behavior, while adding the support to limit the interval.

## Features

* Allows limiting the time interval
* Appearance matches exactly that of `UIDatePicker` in countDownTimer mode
* *hours* label changes to *hour* when 1 hour is selected
* informs of changes using callback block `^onTimeIntervalChanged(NSTimeInterval interval)`
* supports setting step (1 min, 5 min, 20 min etc.), same as in UIDatePicker
* when `maxTimeInterval` is bigger than 1 hour, minutes can be scrolled infinitely
* direct subclass of `UIPickerView` - you get the same sizing as with date pickers

## How do I use it?

Since GSTimeIntervalPicker is a subclass of UIPickerView, it carries its intrinsic content size and therefore plays nicely with Autolayout, inputViews, and self-sizing cells. Using it is really simple, it's basically a drop-in replacement of UIDatePicker.

The basic setup in code could look something like this: 

```
GSTimeIntervalPicker *picker = [[GSTimeIntervalPicker alloc] init];
picker.maxTimeInterval = (3600 * 3);    // set the limit
picker.minuteInterval = 5;				// the step. Default is 1 minute
picker.timeInterval = (3600 * 1.5);    	// 1 h 45 minutes
picker.onTimeIntervalChanged = ^(NSTimeInterval newTimeInterval) {
	// Use the value
};
```

Now, here are some notes on common use cases:

###Â As an inputView

Simply assign the picker to the `inputView` property of your first responder like so:

```
myFirstResponderObject.inputView = picker;
```

Note: If you are using something else than textView / textField, you might need to create a readwrite property for the inputView, because for some strange reason, UIResponder defines it as read-only. For more details, consult this great guide by Apple [Custom Views for Data Input](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/InputViews/InputViews.html)


### As a self-sizing cell
Create a cell and place this picker inside of it, pinning it to all 4 sides. I prefer using Storyboards and prototype cells for that:

1. Make your cell `217` points tall. (pickers are 216 points by default, so 1 extra point is for the cell separator)
2. Drag a `UIPickerView` into your cell, and set its class to `GSTimeIntervalPicker` in the Identity Inspector
3. Pin it to all 4 sides, like so:

### As just a view in your view controller 

That's pretty much the same as using it in the table view cell, and more details are beyond the scope of this readme.

I hope you'll find this helpful :). And - I know, it's *not in Swift*! I might convert it one day. For now, if you need Swift version, take it as an exercise to convert it yourself.
